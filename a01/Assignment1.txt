Assignment 1: warm-up: Minesweeper

Implement the hint-functionality for the minesweeper game discussed in the PS.
Stick to the following format:

Sample input    Sample output
(from file)     (to System.out)

4 4             Field: 1
*...            *100
....            2210
.*..            1*10 
.... 	        1110
3 5             Field: 2
**...           **100
.....           33200
.*...           1*100 
0 0             22


Additionally, your program shall implement the following interface, where the return value of 
the method minesweep shall be the sum of all integers in the output fields (for the example 
above, this is 22):

import java.io.File;

public interface Assignment1 {
	public long minesweep(File inputfile) throws Exception;
}

Note: do not use the Java 'package' statement.
Note: No teamwork this time.
